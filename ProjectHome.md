### MESSAGE ABOUT PROJECT STATUS ###


Hi All,

The OCTLAB project was started while I was a post doctoral fellow in University of Houston (Texas, USA). Since that time I'm working for medical device companies, and, thus, could not contribute enough efforts to continue the development of this project. That's why, I encourage you to continue its development, contribute to this project, or become project developer, or even lead OCTLab. Luckily, the same time OCTLab is an open source project. So, you can use any parts of my previous code under the terms of [the Clear BSD license](http://www.octlab.org/svn/trunk/COPYRIGHT.TXT)!
